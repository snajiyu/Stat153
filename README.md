# Stock-Price-Forecasting

Lots-of-stuff Incorporated (LOSI) (fictional company based on weighed average of two similar retail stocks) is a company that produces everything from paper and pens to water bottles.
They usually partner with mid-size retail stores to sell their products. 
Their stock price has been doing well for several years, increasing gradually, on average.
The company is excited to move past the turmoil of 2020, as are investors. 
However, they are nervous about the start of 2021 as some experts think that the over-anticipation for getting out of 2020 into the new year will cause recent increases to disappear and the price to drop a bit.
So, for their end-of-year board meeting, they would like a high-quality, data-based forecast for the first two weeks of 2021 
(i.e. the first 10 trading days, Jan 4 through Jan 15).


The steps applied to build an optimal model for forecasting include: Time series filtering and detrending, modeling noise autocoreelation.
